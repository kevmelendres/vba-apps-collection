The main functionality of this program is to produce files needed to model structures in Perform-3D. 

In order to optimize the design, strucutres modelled from ETABS are modelled and analyzed again in Perform-3D. 
Data exported from ETABS are very limited. Only the line elements can be exported from ETABS and imported to Perform-3d.
Several properties essential to analysis are not included in the ETABS export. However, Perform-3D can import certain file 
types in order to aid in the modelling of the structure. This program produces that certain file, which contains the material 
properties of each line element.
